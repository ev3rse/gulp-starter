## Install dependencies

Before running your gulp project you need to install the dependencies.
Run the following command in your terminal, at the root the project:
```
yarn install
```

### Run gulp
For the first time, use the following command to build the 'dist' folder:
```
yarn build
```
Use this command everytime you want to clean & rebuild the dist folder.

You can now run the project.
Run the following command:
```
yarn watch
```
You can work now. Happy development ðŸ¤˜
